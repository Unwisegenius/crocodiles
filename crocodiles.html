                    <p class="large">Bruno Schulz was a remarkable Polish-Jewish writer and artist, best known for
                        his evocative and surreal prose that intertwines the extraordinary with the mundane, often
                        drawing on his own childhood experiences in the small town of Drohobych.</p>

                <h3 id="About">About the Author</h3>
                <p class="normal">Born in 1892, Schulz's literary career was marked by his two major works, "The
                    Street
                    of
                    Crocodiles" and "Sanatorium Under the Sign of the Hourglass," both of which highlight his unique
                    style
                    characterised by rich imagery and intricate metaphors. His writings reflect a deep sense of
                    nostalgia
                    and an uncanny ability to capture the complexities of human emotion and memory. </p>

                <p>In addition to his literary contributions, Schulz was a talented visual artist, illustrating his
                    own
                    works and creating remarkable paintings that complemented his narratives. Tragically, his life
                    was
                    cut
                    short during the Holocaust, but his legacy endures, influencing countless writers and artists
                    with
                    his
                    imaginative storytelling and profound exploration of identity and memory.

                <h2>Read an extract from 'The Street of Crocodiles' by Bruno Schulz</h2>
                <h3>“Chapter one: August</h3>
                <p> In July my father went to take the waters and left me, with my mother and elder brother, a
                    prey to the
                    blinding white heat of the summer days. Dizzy with light, we dipped into that enormous book
                    of holidays,
                    its pages blazing with sunshine and scented with the sweet melting pulp of golden pears.</p>
                <p>On those luminous mornings Adela returned from the market, like Pomona emerging from the
                    flames of day,
                    spilling from her basket the colourful beauty of the sun — the shiny pink cherries full of
                    juice under
                    their transparent skins, the mysterious black morellos that smelled so much better than they
                    tasted;
                    apricots in whose golden pulp lay the core of long afternoons. And next to that pure poetry
                    of fruit,
                    she unloaded sides of meat with their keyboard of ribs swollen with energy and strength, and
                    seaweeds of
                    vegetables like dead octopuses and squids — the raw material of meals with a yet undefined
                    taste, the
                    vegetative and terrestrial ingredients of dinner, exuding a wild and rustic smell.</p>
                <img src="images/august.jpg" alt="The dark second-floor apartment of the house in Market Square">
                <p>The dark second-floor apartment of the house in Market Square was shot through each day by
                    the naked heat
                    of summer: the silence of the shimmering streaks of air, the squares of brightness dreaming
                    their
                    intense dreams on the floor; the sound of a barrel organ rising from the deepest golden vein
                    of day; two
                    or three bars of a chorus, played on a distant piano over and over again, melting in the sun
                    on the
                    white pavement, lost in the fire of high noon. </p>
                <p>After tidying up, Adela would plunge the rooms into semi-darkness by drawing down the linen
                    blinds. All
                    colours immediately fell an octave lower, the room filled with shadows, as if it had sunk to
                    the bottom
                    of the sea and the light was reflected in mirrors of green water — and the heat of the day
                    began to
                    breathe on the blinds as they stirred slightly in their daydreams.</p>
                <p>On Saturday afternoons I used to go for a walk with my mother. From the dusk of the hallway,
                    we stepped
                    at once into the brightness of the day. The passers-by, bathed in melting gold, had their
                    eyes half
                    closed against the glare, as if they were drenched with honey. Upper lips were drawn back,
                    exposing the
                    teeth. Everyone in this golden day wore that grimace of heat — as if the sun had forced his
                    worshippers
                    to wear identical masks of gold. The old and the young, women and children, greeted each
                    other with
                    these masks, painted on their faces with thick gold paint; they smiled at each other’s pagan
                    faces — the
                    barbaric smiles of Bacchus.</p>

                <h2>Market Square</h2>
                <p>Market Square was empty and white-hot, swept by hot winds like a biblical desert. The
                    thorny acacias,
                    growing in this emptiness, looked with their bright leaves like the trees on old
                    tapestries. Although
                    there was no breath of wind, they rustled their foliage in a theatrical gesture, as if
                    wanting to
                    display the elegance of the silver lining of their leaves that resembled the fox-fur
                    lining of a
                    nobleman’s coat. The old houses, worn smooth by the winds of innumerable days, played
                    tricks with the
                    reflections of the atmosphere, with echoes and memories of colours scattered in the
                    depth of the
                    cloudless sky. It seemed as if whole generations of summer days, like patient
                    stonemasons cleaning the
                    mildewed plaster from old facades, had removed the deceptive varnish revealing more and
                    more clearly the
                    true face of the houses, the features that fate had given them and life had shaped for
                    them from the
                    inside. Now the windows, blinded by the glare of the empty square, had fallen asleep;
                    the balconies
                    declared their emptiness to heaven; the open doorways smelt of coolness and wine.</p>
                <img src="images/marketsquare.jpg" alt="image of a market">
                <p>A bunch of ragamuffins, sheltering in a corner of the square from the flaming broom of
                    the heat,
                    beleaguered a piece of wall, throwing buttons and coins at it over and over again, as if
                    wishing to read
                    in the horoscope of those metal discs the real secret written in the hieroglyphics of
                    cracks and
                    scratched lines. Apart from them, the square was deserted. One expected that, any
                    minute, the
                    Samaritan’s donkey, led by the bridle, would stop in front of the wine merchant’s
                    vaulted doorway and
                    that two servants would carefully ease a sick man from the red-hot saddle and carry him
                    slowly up the
                    cool stairs to the floor above, already redolent of the Sabbath.</p>
                <p>Thus my mother and I ambled along the two sunny sides of Market Square, guiding our
                    broken shadows along
                    the houses as over a keyboard. Under our soft steps the squares of the paving stones
                    slowly filed past —
                    some the pale pink of human skin, some golden, some blue-grey, all flat, warm and
                    velvety in the sun,
                    like sundials, trodden to the point of obliteration, into blessed nothingness.</p>

                    <h2>Stryjska Street</h2>
                    <p>And finally on the corner of Stryjska Street we passed within the shadow of the
                        chemist’s shop. A large
                        jar of raspberry juice in the wide window symbolized the coolness of balms which can
                        relieve all kinds
                        of pain. After we passed a few more houses, the street ceased to maintain any
                        pretence of urbanity, like
                        a man returning to his little village who, piece by piece, strips off his Sunday
                        best, slowly changing
                        back into a peasant as he gets closer to his home.</p>
                    <p>The suburban houses were sinking, windows and all, into the exuberant tangle of
                        blossom in their little
                        gardens. Overlooked by the light of day, weeds and wild flowers of all kinds
                        luxuriated quietly, glad of
                        the interval for dreams beyond the margin of time on the borders of an endless day.
                        An enormous
                        sunflower, lifted on a powerful stem and suffering from hypertrophy, clad in the
                        yellow mourning of the
                        last sorrowful days of its life, bent under the weight of its monstrous girth. But
                        the naive suburban
                        bluebells and unpretentious dimity flowers stood helpless in their starched pink and
                        white shifts,
                        indifferent to the sunflower’s tragedy.”</p>
